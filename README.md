# Diffusion Model-Based Generative AI

> A deep dive into the diffusion models and their applications in generative AI.

## Course Overview

This course provides an in-depth exploration of diffusion models and their applications in generative artificial intelligence. As generative AI technologies rapidly advance, diffusion models show tremendous potential in fields such as image generation, natural language processing, and more. This course aims to equip students with a strong theoretical foundation in these emerging technologies while enhancing their programming skills and ability to apply diffusion models to real-world problems.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand** the fundamental theories and algorithms behind diffusion models.
- **Master** the implementation and optimization of generative AI models.
- **Apply** diffusion models to solve complex real-world problems.
- **Practice** developing practical generative AI applications through engineering projects.

## Prerequisites

<!-- - Basic understanding of deep learning (e.g., neural networks, convolutional networks).
- Proficiency in Python and familiarity with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- Basic knowledge of probability theory and calculus. -->

- **Python Proficiency**: All assignments will be in Python and will utilize libraries such as `Numpy`,`PyTorch`. A Python tutorial is available for those less familiar with the language. If you have significant programming experience in another language (e.g., C/C++, Matlab), you should still be able to follow along without issue.

- **College-Level Calculus and Linear Algebra**: You should have a solid grasp of calculus concepts such as derivatives, and be comfortable with matrix-vector operations and related notation.

- **Basic Probability and Statistics**: A foundational understanding of probability and statistics is required. You should be familiar with concepts like probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian distributions), mean, standard deviation, and similar topics.
